                Paleolithic people of the Korean Peninsula:
                <span class="tooltiptxt">ok. this is boring from the beginning</span>
            </span> 
            Humans first appeared in Africa and settled in Manchuria and the Korean Peninsula after a long migration. It is estimated that people have lived on the Korean Peninsula since about 700,000 years ago. Relics from the Paleolithic era are found in various regions of the Korean Peninsula, with representative sites including Black Anvil Cave in Sangwon, South Pyongan Province, and Jeongok-ri, Yeoncheon, Gyeonggi Province. In particular, the Black Anvil Cave ruins date from around the same time that Homo erectus, the Beijing Man of China, appeared, and are known to be the oldest Paleolithic ruins in Korea. Human bones were also discovered in the Yeokpo district of Pyongyang. People of the Paleolithic Age evolved and developed tools while adapting to the natural environment.
            People of the Paleolithic Age made tools using stones, wood, and animal bones. They used cut stone tools such as hand axes, choppers, and cutters to hunt animals and cut up meat. They mainly lived in caves or in the shade of rocks, and sometimes lived in huts by the river. They lived on the move in groups and obtained food through gathering, fishing, and hunting. Also, as people cooked and ate food using fire, their nutritional status improved. In the late Paleolithic period, people made more sophisticated tools. Tanged stone blades joined to wood were used, and obsidian, which was used to make rubble stone tools, was also exchanged with distant regions such as Japan. Meanwhile, sculptures in the shape of whales or fish were made to pray for the prosperity of the group and the acquisition of abundant food. Paleolithic society was an equal society with no differences between rich and poor or classes.
            After the Ice Age ended, the Neolithic Age began around 8000 BC in Manchuria and the Korean Peninsula. As the weather got warmer, forests became thicker and the number of small, agile animals such as roe deer, wild boars, and rabbits increased. To catch these animals, people made more elaborate stone tools by grinding stones. People of the Neolithic Age lived in huts near rivers or the sea. They used harpoons made from animal bones or horns, fishing hooks, and nets with weights to catch fish or shellfish. Additionally, food such as acorns and other tree fruits, roots, and meat were obtained through gathering and hunting. They made and used earthenware to store and cook food, and also used spinning wheels and bone needles to make clothes and nets. In the late Neolithic Age, primitive farming and herding began. People cultivated millet, millet, and other crops using stone hoes and plowshares, and raised pigs and goats as livestock.
            Earthenware is a vessel needed for storing, transporting, or cooking food. soil
            Pottery made from an appropriate model and fired over fire is a window that shook human history.
            It was a medical invention. In various regions of the world, humans have made various types of earthenware suitable for use according to the natural environment and living customs. By boiling or steaming food using earthenware, humans were able to consume more nutrients, and their resistance to disease increased, greatly increasing the population.
            During the Neolithic Age, the surface of pottery was painted in the Yellow River basin of China.
            Taoism developed, and in Japan, Jomon pottery decorated with rope patterns developed. On the Korean Peninsula, pottery with a patterned pattern, pottery with a pressed pattern, and pottery with a comb pattern were made, the most representative of which is the comb pattern pottery, which is found throughout the Korean Peninsula.

                  The Bronze Age culture introduced to Manchuria starting around 2000 BC gradually spread throughout the Korean Peninsula. Bronze is an alloy of copper, tin, zinc, etc., and people melted the bronze by applying heat and then used molds to make weapons such as swords and axes, ceremonial tools such as mirrors and bells, and accessories. Representative relics of the Bronze Age discovered in Manchuria and the Korean Peninsula include loquat-shaped bronze swords, mirrors with rough patterns, and various types of plain pottery without patterns. Bronze tools were difficult to obtain and were not suitable for tilling the land or cutting down trees. For this reason, household tools such as half-moon stone knives and agricultural tools were still made of stone or wood. As an independent Bronze Age cultural sphere developed around Manchuria and the Korean Peninsula, our nation was gradually formed. and
                  Bronzeware was introduced to Japan around the 3rd century BC by people who came from the Korean Peninsula.
                  In Manchuria and the Korean Peninsula, an independent bronze age culture, different from that of China, developed. Such differences can be identified through the type and shape of bronze swords or ceremonial tools. The shape of the lute-shaped bronze sword from Manchuria and the Korean Peninsula is different from the Chinese bronze sword, but unlike the Chinese bronze sword or the Ordos bronze sword, the blade and handle are made and assembled separately. In the Korean Peninsula, the lute-shaped bronze sword gradually developed into a three-shaped bronze sword. The three-type bronze sword was mainly used on the Korean Peninsula south of the Cheongcheon River from the late Bronze Age to the early Iron Age, so it is also called the Korean-style bronze sword.
                  Farming, which began in the Neolithic Age, was further developed in the Bronze Age, and various grains such as millet, millet, and sorghum were cultivated. Rice farming also spread in the southern region of the Korean Peninsula. Meanwhile, it has become common to raise livestock such as pigs in cages. People lived in villages near rivers or on gentle hills where farming was done. As productivity increased due to the development of agriculture, the population increased, and differences between rich and poor and classes arose. Additionally, as fights between groups over food often occurred, defense facilities were built in the village. As a result of wars between groups, powerful political forces emerged, and the chieftains (chiefs) leading the groups gradually increased their power. They used not only political power but also religious authority to hold ancestral rites to heaven to dominate the group. Through dolmens found in Manchuria and the Korean Peninsula, we can see the image of a ruler who had the power to mobilize a large amount of labor.
                  After around 2000 BC, countries were established in the Yellow River basin thanks to the development of Bronze Age culture and increased productivity. Advanced groups with economic and military power emerged in parts of Manchuria and the Korean Peninsula based on advanced agriculture and excellent bronze production technology. They conquered other groups or formed alliances with them to expand their power and grow into a powerful political force. In this process, Gojoseon, the first nation in our history, was established. According to 『Dongguk Tonggam』, Dangun Wanggeom founded Gojoseon in 2333 BC. Dangun means a priest, and Wanggeom means a political head. Through this, we can see that Dangun Wanggeom is the ruler of a society that is consistent with government. Gojoseon initially grew around the Liaodong region, but later its center moved to the Daedong River basin in the northwest of the Korean Peninsula. Table-style dolmens, loquat-shaped bronze swords, and Misong-ri-style pottery are presumed to be cultural heritage related to Gojoseon.
